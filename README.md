# Take-Home Assessment for Stage Two Interview - Junior Developer Test

I was tasked with completing five take-home assessments as part of my stage two interview process. The purpose of this test was to evaluate my problem-solving skills, coding abilities, and familiarity with GitHub workflows.

Since the tasks required the use of TypeScript and React, I set up the project using Vite as the build tool, with React as the framework and TypeScript as the environment.

# Brief Description of the Tasks
- Part 1, 3 and 4 can be viewed in src/App.tsx
- Part 2 can be viewed in src/components/Greeting/Greeting.tsx
- Part 5 will be presented during the stage 3 interview 

# Part 1: Find the Largest Number in an Array
- I wrote a TypeScript function that accepts an array of numbers and returns the largest number in the array
- If the array is empty, the function returns null

# Part 2: Build a React Component to Display a Greeting
- I created a React component that accepts a name as a prop
- The component displays Hello, (name) if a name is provided or Hello, Guest if no name is passed

# Part 3: Debug a Function to Calculate Total Price
- I debugged a buggy function to ensure it calculates the total price correctly
- The function takes price and tax rate as parameters and returns the total price

# Part 4: Count Delivered Orders
- I wrote a function that takes a list of delivery orders and returns the number of orders where delivered is true

# Part 5: Communication Exercise
- Explain my solution for one of the tasks in simple terms, as if I were talking to a non-technical person
- For part 5, I could either submit it in writing or present it during the review interview
- I'm choosing to present it during the 3rd stage interview when we review my code

# Project Organization
- I separated and labeled each task in the files with comments, such as // Task: Part 1, to easily see where each task begin 
- For each task, I used console.log to display the results in the browserâ€™s console for easy testing

# Instructions on how to run and test the solutions locally 

# Clone the repository
- Open the terminal on your computer
- Navigate to a folder where you want to store the project
- Then clone the repository using the command: git clone https://github.com/AnnaKiira/junior-developer-test.git 

# Navigate to the project directory 
- Once cloned, move into the project folder

# Install dependencies 
- Install required dependencies using npm install

# Start the development server 
- Run the following command: npm run dev
- Navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal (localhost)

# Open the developer tools to view console logs
- Open inspect in the browser
- Navigate to the console tab in the developer tools
- Here, you will see the console.log outputs for my solutions
